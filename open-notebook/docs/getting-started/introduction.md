# Welcome to Open Notebook

## What is Open Notebook?

Open Notebook is a powerful, open-source AI-powered research and note-taking platform that puts privacy and user control at the heart of knowledge management. Designed as a privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM, Open Notebook empowers researchers, students, and professionals to organize, analyze, and interact with their research materials using cutting-edge AI technology—all while maintaining complete control over their data.

At its core, Open Notebook serves as your personal **cognitive partner**, helping you process information, generate insights, and create compelling content from your research materials. Whether you're a student working on a thesis, a researcher analyzing complex documents, or a professional synthesizing industry reports, Open Notebook provides the tools to enhance your learning and knowledge creation workflows.

## Key Features & Benefits

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture
Unlike cloud-based alternatives, Open Notebook runs entirely on your infrastructure, ensuring your sensitive research data never leaves your control. You decide what information to share with AI models and when.

### 🤖 Multi-Model AI Support
Choose from industry-leading AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Mistral, DeepSeek, Ollama (free/local), and many more. This flexibility ensures you're never locked into a single provider and can optimize for cost, performance, or specific capabilities.

### 🎙️ Advanced Podcast Generation
Transform your research into engaging podcasts with 1-4 customizable speakers—a significant improvement over Google Notebook LM's 2-speaker limitation. Create professional-quality audio content with Episode Profiles for consistent, branded output.

### 🔍 Intelligent Search & Discovery
Built-in full-text and vector search capabilities help you quickly locate information across all your research materials, notes, and conversations.

### ⚙️ Fine-Grained Context Control
Precisely manage what information gets shared with AI models through three context levels:
- **No Context**: AI operates without your documents
- **Summary Only**: AI receives condensed summaries
- **Full Content**: AI accesses complete document text

### 🛠️ Powerful Content Transformations
Create custom prompts to extract insights, generate summaries, analyze themes, and transform your content in ways that match your specific research needs.

### 📖 AI-Powered Note Creation
Generate notes manually or let AI assist in creating insights from your research materials, with seamless integration between human and AI-generated content.
